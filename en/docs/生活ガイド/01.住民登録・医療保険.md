When you complete Resident Registration (Moving-in/Relocation), the official at the municipal office will manually write your new address on the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">back</span> of your Residence Card.

You will be required to submit this in many situations, such as `opening a bank account`, signing a smartphone `contract`, or applying for a `part-time job`.

Once the registration process is complete, you can have it <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">issued immediately</span>.

National Health Insurance is Japan’s public medical insurance system. Foreign nationals staying in Japan for <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">3 months or more</span> are required to join.

Once enrolled, you must pay <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">National Health Insurance premiums</span>. In return, when you receive medical treatment at a hospital, you generally only need to pay <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">30%</span> of the total medical costs (if you are not enrolled, you must pay 100%).

For most students, the monthly premium often ranges from <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">¥1,500 to ¥2,500</span> (after applying for student reductions).
