Waste disposal rules in Japan are <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">extremely detailed</span> by global standards, and rules can vary completely depending on the area where you live.

Failing to follow the correct procedures can lead to trouble with neighbors or landlords, and your trash might be left uncollected. <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">Please pay close attention to local guidelines</span>.

#### <div class="custom-title">Basic Waste Categories</div>

Generally, waste is divided into `4 to 6` categories. However, classification methods may differ by municipality.
<br>

| Category                 | Common Examples                                    | Instructions & Notes                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `Burnable` (Kanen)       | Food waste, soiled paper, clothing, wood products. | Drain excess liquids from food.                 |
| `Non-burnable` (Funen)   | Metal, glass, ceramics, small appliances.          | Wrap broken items and mark as "DANGER" (Kiken). |
| `Recyclables`            | PET bottles, cans, glass bottles, old paper.       | Rinse and dry before disposing.                 |
| `Plastic Waste`          | Food trays, wrappers, cups/containers.             | Check for the "pla" mark; rinse lightly.        |
| `Oversized` (Sodai Gomi) | Furniture, bicycles, futons.                       | Requires advanced application and a fee.        |

#### <div class="custom-title">The "3 Golden Rules" of Waste Disposal</div>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Use "Designated Bags"</p>

<img src='../../../images/i-img1200x620-1678874508903ha1dl8.jpg' class=' rounded-2xl'>

In many municipalities, waste will not be collected unless it is in official designated garbage bags, which are <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">sold at supermarkets and convenience stores</span>. Rules on whether you can use standard plastic shopping bags vary by region.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Follow "Days" and "Times"</p>

<br>

<img src='../../../images/gomisuteba.jpeg' class='rounded-2xl w-90 mx-auto'>

<br>

Each category of waste has a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">specific collection day</span> (e.g., "Mondays are for Burnable Waste").

Waste is generally put out by <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">8:00 AM</span> on the day of collection. Putting trash out the night before is often <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">prohibited</span> as it can attract crows or become a fire hazard.

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Use the "Correct Location"</p>

<img src='../../../images/20190423-114141.png' class='rounded-2xl'>

<br>

Take your trash to the designated "<span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">Collection Point</span>" (Gomi-shukesyo). This may be a private area for your apartment or a shared "Gomi Station" for the neighborhood. Leaving trash on someone else's property because it is closer is considered a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">crime (Illegal Dumping)</span>.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Penalties and Trouble</p>

<br>

<img src='../../../images/51PRZY3lCEL._AC_SX679_.jpg' class='rounded-2xl w-90 mx-auto'>

<br>

Illegal dumping carries severe penalties. Dumping waste in forests, on roads, or on others' property is prohibited by law. Violators can face up to <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">5 years of imprisonment or fines of up to 10 million yen</span>.

Furthermore, repeatedly ignoring disposal rules can lead to complaints from neighbors, which may result in <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">your apartment lease being terminated</span>.

<br>

#### <div class="custom-title">Proper Disposal Methods (Crucial)</div>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>The "3R" Rules for Recyclables</p>

Recyclable items (bottles, cans, etc.) <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">must not</span> be thrown away as-is. Follow these steps:
<br>

| Action  | Description                                                                                         |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rinse   | Finish the contents and rinse lightly with water to prevent odors and dirt.                         |
| Remove  | Remove `caps` and `labels` from PET bottles. These are usually sorted as plastic resources.         |
| Recycle | Place the `bottle`, `cap`, and `label` into their respective designated bins or bags.               |
| Note    | Plastics with `unremovable dirt` (e.g., oily containers) are generally treated as "Burnable Waste." |

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Handling Dangerous Items</p>

These rules are essential to <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">prevent fires and injuries</span> at collection trucks or processing facilities.

<br>

| Type                       | Disposal Method / Notes                                                                                                    |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Spray Cans / Gas Canisters | Must be `completely empty`. Shake to confirm there is no sound inside.                                                     |
| Batteries                  | `NEVER` mix with regular trash; they cause fires. Use `designated collection boxes` at electronics stores or supermarkets. |
| Blades / Broken Glass      | `Wrap` securely in cardboard or newspaper and clearly `mark` the bag as "`DANGER`" (Kiken).                                |

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Organizing Paper Products</p>

Magazines, newspapers, and cardboard should be <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">tied in a cross with string rather than put in bags</span>.
<br>

| Type                    | Disposal Method / Notes                                                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cardboard               | Must be `flattened` before tying with string.                                                    |
| Small Paper (Zatsugami) | Collect `envelopes` and `flyers` in a paper bag or sandwich them between magazines before tying. |

<br>

#### <div class="custom-title">What about Oversized Waste (Sodai Gomi)?</div>

Furniture and appliances will <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">never be collected</span> if you simply leave them at the regular collection point. In Japan, disposing of large items requires a `reservation` and a `fee` (handling charge).

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Furniture and Small Appliances</p>

This applies to items where one side exceeds <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">30cm–50cm</span> (e.g., futons, desks, chairs, bicycles, microwaves).

| Step              | Action                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Application       | Apply via phone or internet to the `municipality's Oversized Waste Reception Center`                 |
| Details           | State the `type`, `size`, and `quantity` of the items.                                               |
| Confirmation      | You will be given a `collection date` and the `fee` amount.                                          |
| Purchase Stickers | Buy an `Oversized Waste Processing Ticket` (sticker) for the required amount at a convenience store. |
| Labeling          | Write your `name` or `reception number` on the sticker and attach it prominently to the item.        |
| Disposal          | Place the item outside your entrance or at the `designated spot` on the `scheduled` morning.         |

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Appliances That Cannot Be Thrown Away</p>

The following <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">four types</span> of appliances cannot be disposed of as oversized waste. Recycling is mandated by law.

`Refrigerators/Freezers`, `Washing Machines/Dryers`, `Televisions`,` Air Conditioners`

<br>

| Scenario      | Method / Cost                                                                        |
