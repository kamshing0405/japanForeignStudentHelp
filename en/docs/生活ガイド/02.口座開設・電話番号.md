Both a bank account and a phone number are <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">essential</span> for living in Japan.

However, you may find yourself in a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">chicken and egg situation</span>: you often need a phone number to open a bank account, and a bank account to pay for a phone plan.

For international students today, the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">smoothest approach</span> is to secure a phone number (SIM card) first, then open a bank account.

For international students, getting a phone number (SIM card) is the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">highest priority</span>, even before opening a bank account.

    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Credit Cards</p>
</div>

Generally, the credit card for payments must be in <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">your own name</span>. It is safer to have a major international card (<span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">Visa, Mastercard, or JCB</span>) before arriving.

    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Voice Call Plans</p>
</div>

There are two types of SIMs; ensure you choose "<span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">Voice + Data</span>." Without a real phone number (starting with 090/080/070), <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">you cannot open a bank account</span>.

    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Applying in Internet</p>
</div>

To apply phone number by internet, a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">Japan phone number</span> is required (you may need a friend's number or school support if you haven't secured your own yet).

### <div class="relative font-bold text-2xl pb-3 after:absolute after:left-0 after:bottom-0 after:w-full after:border-b-4 after:border-dotted after:border-blue-600">Opening a Bank Account</div>

According to the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act, foreigners who have been in Japan for <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">less than 6 months are considered "non-residents"</span>, and many banks will <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">refuse to open accounts</span>. However, <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">Japan Post Bank</span> (Yucho Bank) is an exception and allows students to open accounts immediately.

#### <div class="custom-title">Japan Post Bank (Yucho Bank)</div>

Japan Post Bank is the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">top choice</span> for new arrivals because its residency requirement is only "<span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">3 months or more</span>." The application forms are available in <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">English, Chinese, and Vietnamese etc</span>, and no Inkan (seal) is required. Its high accessibility for those who cannot speak Japanese yet makes it the most <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">user-friendly bank</span> for starting your life in Japan.
