<h2 class=' text-center'>Prepare for job searching</h2>

The period of preparing for job hunting is a crucial stage for university students. Generally, job hunting (<ruby>就職活動<rp>(</rp><rt>しゅうしょくかつどう</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>) starts in the spring of the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">third year of university</span>, but ideally, preparation should begin even earlier.

Here, we introduce what you should start working on once you begin to focus on preparing for job hunting.

<span class="bg-blue-500 w-48 px-3 py-1 rounded-2xl text-4 text-sm text-white">Activity period: Ideally Start Early</span>

The purpose of self-analysis is to gain an objective understanding of your <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">personality, values, strengths, and weaknesses</span>

This allows you to <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">clarify the types of jobs and work environments that suit you</span>, providing a foundation for considering your future direction.

In addition, in job hunting, self-analysis is essential for making your motivation for <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">applying and self-promotion statements specific and convincing</span>. By drawing on your own experiences as evidence, you can <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">accurately convey your strengths and appeal to prospective employers</span>.
