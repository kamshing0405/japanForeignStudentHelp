<h1 style="text-align: center;">School Selection</h1>

To succeed in studying abroad, careful prior planning is extremely important. Have you properly prepared your study abroad plan?

The first thing to consider is the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">type of educational institution</span>. Japanese higher education institutions differ significantly in their roles and characteristics depending on what you want to study and what kind of career path you want to pursue.

Therefore, it is essential to clearly define your study abroad objectives and select the appropriate educational institution that aligns with them.

Because Japan’s entrance examination system and visa (residence status) application procedures take a lot of time, starting the process <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">one year in advance</span> will broaden your options and help prevent mistakes.
