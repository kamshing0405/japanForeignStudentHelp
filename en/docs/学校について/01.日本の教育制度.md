<h1 style="text-align: center;">Overview of Higher Education in Japan</h1>

Higher education in Japan begins after completing a total of <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">12 years</span> of compulsory education, which includes 6 years of elementary school and 6 years of secondary education (3 years of junior high school and 3 years of high school).

For international students to enter a Japanese higher education institution, they must have completed the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">12th year of formal school education</span> in their home country.

Higher education institutions that accept international students are mainly divided into the following five categories, and each can be established as <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">national, public, or private</span>. Vocational schools are overwhelmingly private, while about <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">70%</span> of universities are private.

#### <div class="custom-title">Graduate School</div>

Graduate schools are educational institutions where students conduct advanced and specialized research in theory and application after completing a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">undergraduate program (bachelor’s degree)</span>.

Many graduate schools provide a preparatory period of six months to one year as a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">“research student”</span> before formal enrollment.

An increasing number of graduate schools now offer <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">English-taught degree programs</span>, allowing students to earn a degree entirely in English.
