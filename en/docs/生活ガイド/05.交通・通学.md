"Transportation and Commuting" in Japan is a crucial part of an international <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">student's daily life and expenses</span>. Here are the key points for using these services wisely.

#### <div class="custom-title">Student Commuter Pass (Tsugaku Teikiken)</div>

<br>

<img src='../../../images/tuukin.png' class='rounded-2xl w-90 mx-auto'>

International students are eligible to purchase a "`Student Commuter Pass`." These are significantly cheaper than standard worker passes, typically discounted by `50% to 80%`.

#### <div class="custom-title">Transportation IC Cards</div>

<span class="bg-blue-500 w-48 px-3 py-1 rounded-2xl text-4 text-sm text-white">Mobile app is the Mainstream</span>

<img src='../../../images/money_ic_card.png' class='rounded-2xl w-60 mx-auto'>

While restrictions on issuing physical cards (Suica or PASMO) are being eased, using "`Mobile Suica`" or "`Mobile PASMO`" on your smartphone is the most convenient option.

By registering a credit card (many international cards are now supported) with `Apple Pay` or `Google Pay`, you can top up your balance instantly.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Benefits</p>

- No need to `wait in line` at ticket machines; top-ups and pass renewals can be done on your phone.

- Can be used for payments at `convenience stores` and `vending machines`.
- If you lose your phone, you can `suspend` and `reissue` the card online.

#### <div class="custom-title">Rules for Commuting by Bicycle</div>

Many students live slightly further from school to <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">save on rent and commute by bicycle</span>. However, Japan has <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">strict rules</span> regarding bicycle use.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Rules</p>

- `Anti-theft registration` (Bohai Toroku) is mandatory. Whether you buy a new bike or receive a used one, you must register it (approx. `¥500–¥600`).

- `Bicycle insurance` is `compulsory` in many municipalities. It costs only a `few hundred` yen per month and covers liability in case of an accident; you can even sign up at `convenience stores`.

- Always park in designated "`Bicycle Parking Lots`." Leaving a bike on the street will lead to it being towed, costing several `thousand yen` to retrieve.

<br>

#### <div class="custom-title">Etiquette for Trains and Buses</div>

Public transportation in Japan has specific `etiquette` to follow to avoid trouble.
<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8 '>Etiquette</p>

- Keep Quiet: Talking on the phone is normally not allowed. Be careful with "`sound leakage`" from your headphones.

- Line Up: When waiting for a train or bus,` wait in line` according to the marks on the floor.

- Priority Seats: These are for the `elderly`, `people with disabilities`, or `pregnant women`.

<br>

#### <div class="custom-title">Long-Distance Travel (Trips or Returning Home)</div>

- Student Discount Certificate (Gakuwari): Issued by your school, this provides a `20% discount` on JR fares for one-way trips exceeding 100km.

- Overnight Buses: For travel between cities like Tokyo and Osaka, these are a student's best friend as they cost less than `half` the price of the Shinkansen.

- LCC (Low-Cost Carriers): Using Narita or Kansai International Airport as a base, you can travel domestically quite `cheaply`.
