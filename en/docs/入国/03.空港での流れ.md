If this is your first time coming to Japan, it’s normal to feel nervous. But don’t worry—Japan is a very welcoming country for first-time visitors.

This guide explains the steps specifically for entering Japan with a `student visa` after arriving at `major airports` such as Narita, Haneda, Kansai, and Chubu.

- Follow the `designated route` after disembarking the plane

- Currently, the process mainly involves `questions` about your health status and temperature screening using thermography

- If you are feeling `unwell`, please consult a staff member here

    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Immigration</p>
</div>

- Proceed to the counter for `mid to long-term residents` (Student)

- Items to present(`passport`, `visa`, and the `Visit Japan Web` QR code or `paper` immigration card)

- Procedures（`fingerprints` will be taken and a `photograph` will be captured）

- Receiving your Residence Card (For student visa holders, the Residence Card is issued on the spot. Make sure to check immediately that your `name` and `date of birth` are correct)

<br>

::: warning 　 Permission to Engage in Activity Other Than That Permitted

If you plan to work part-time, submit your application form during this inspection. A stamp will be placed on the back of your Residence Card on the spot. (It is best to do it now, as applying later may take more time)
