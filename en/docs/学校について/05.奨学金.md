In studying in Japan, scholarships generally do not cover all expenses; they are primarily meant as supplementary support. Therefore, it is important not to rely solely on scholarships and to plan your finances in advance, including your own funds, to ensure you can cover tuition, living costs, and other expenses.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Selection Process</p>

Scholarship selection is not determined solely by grades; generally, the following <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">evaluations</span> are conducted.

| Selection Method | Details                                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Document Review  | Comprehensive evaluation of `grades`, `financial situation`, `research plan`, and `statement of purpose` |
