Recruitment selection is the process by which a company identifies candidates who are best suited for a position from among all applicants. It combines various methods—such as <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">document screening, written tests, interviews, group work, and aptitude tests</span> to evaluate the applicant’s skills, suitability, and motivation

### <div class="relative font-bold text-2xl pb-3 after:absolute after:left-0 after:bottom-0 after:w-full after:border-b-4 after:border-dotted after:border-blue-600">Entry</div>

<span class="bg-blue-500 w-48 px-3 py-1 rounded-2xl text-4 text-sm text-white">Activity period: Spring of fourth year of university</span>

“Entry” refers to <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">the act of expressing your interest</span> in a company. It is a way for candidates to signal to the employer that they are interested in applying

To participate in a company's selection process, it is usually <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">necessary</span> to first submit an entry

In job hunting, entry is divided into two stages: <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">pre-entry and formal entry</span>. It is important to understand the difference between them

<div class="flex relative">

<img src='../../../images/text_entrance.png' class='absolute w-46 right-25 top-5 opacity-20'>

::: tip Pre-entry

- Register your `name` and` university name` on a job site or company's recruitment page
- You will receive a company-specific "`My Page`" and will receive information about information sessions and selection schedules

Entry

- This is an application to participate in the actual `recruitment process` (interviews, etc.)
- `Submit` an application form (ES), `take` an aptitude test (SPI, etc.), and upload your resume
- This allows you to enter the `document screening process`

Application documents such as `Application Sheet` and `Resume` are documents that allow companies to understand the characteristics and information of applicants

<br>

<div class="custom-title">The difference between an entry sheet (ES) and a resume</div>

|         | Entry Sheet (ES)                                           | Resume (Rirekisho)                                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Purpose | Determine selection `pass/fail`                            | Official identity `verification` and fact `confirmation` |
|         | Check `matching` with company                              | Register `HR data`                                       |
| Items   | Basic information: address, name, etc.                     | Basic information: address, name, etc.                   |
|         | `Self-PR`, `motivation`, `school achievements (Gakuchika)` | `Self-PR` and `motivation`                               |
|         | Answers to company-specific `questions`                    | —                                                        |
| Format  | Mostly `custom` questions by the company                   | Standardized (`JIS` format, common)                      |

<br>

A resume is, in a sense, a “proof of identity” in the business world. What companies check first is not so much your skills or achievements, but the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">accuracy of information</span> and <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">honesty</span>.

<br>

On the other hand, an entry sheet (ES) is a “proposal document” that shows how you, as a candidate, can contribute. Unlike a resume, which only shows your specs, what gets evaluated here are your <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">thought process</span> and the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">level of enthusiasm</span> you bring.

Additionally, aptitude tests may still be conducted using paper forms at locations <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">designated by the company</span>.

This allows people in different positions to evaluate the applicant’s personality and thinking, and to determine whether they are a good fit for the company.

Nowadays, it has become common to use <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">a combination of online and in-person interviews</span>, evolving the process from a simple “question-and-answer session” into a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">dialogue where companies and students mutually assess their fit</span>.
