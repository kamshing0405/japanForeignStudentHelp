We have summarized the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">procedures</span> and <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">career considerations</span> for returning to your home country or moving to a country other than Japan after graduating from a Japanese school (university, vocational school, etc.).

Returning after graduation is not just a matter of boarding a plane; it is crucial to organize your <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">residence status (visa)</span> and strategically consider how to leverage the experience you gained in Japan for your future career.

Since your <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">student</span> activities end upon graduation, you must promptly complete the necessary procedures even if your period of stay has not yet expired.

| Item            | Advantages of Working Abroad After Studying in Japan                        | Disadvantages of Working Abroad After Studying in Japan                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Career          | Gain a `global perspective`, `language skills`, and `specialized expertise` | Cannot take advantage of Japan's new graduate hiring system or `long-term training programs` |
| Evaluation      | Young employees can be recognized based on `performance` and `ability`      | Employment and evaluation can be `unstable` if results are lacking                           |
| Work Style      | Many countries have `less overtime` and better work-life balance            | Requires strong `self-management skills`                                                     |
| Salary          | Depending on job type and country, `higher income` than in Japan            | `High cost of living` may increase expenses                                                  |
| Job Stability   | Easier to `change jobs` or get promotions based on ability                  | Lax dismissal regulations make employment `less secure`                                      |
| Relationships   | Flat structures with `less hierarchy`                                       | `Relationships` can feel dry and lead to `loneliness`                                        |
| Daily Life      | Exposure to a `multicultural environment` broadens perspectives             | `Language`, `culture`, and `healthcare system` differences can cause `anxiety`               |
| After Returning | Often highly valued by `foreign-affiliated` or `global companies`           | May be evaluated differently in `Japanese companies`                                         |

#### <div class="custom-title">Necessary preparations</div>

To work meaningfully abroad, preparation is essential. Here, we introduce the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">four key preparations</span> needed to work overseas, which you can use as a reference.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Learn the local language you need</p>

To achieve overseas employment, it is <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">essential</span> not only to have language test scores but also to learn the language as it is actually used locally. Relying only on textbook expressions and grammar makes smooth communication in the workplace and daily life difficult.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Check work visa requirements</p>

To work abroad, it is necessary to check the requirements for a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">work visa</span> in advance. Work visa systems and conditions vary greatly by country, and factors such as educational background, work experience, language proficiency, and the existence of an employment contract are strictly examined.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Determine your purpose for working abroad</p>

To succeed in working abroad, it is important to set a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">clear purpose for why you want to work overseas</span>. If you pursue overseas employment without a clear purpose, it can be difficult to maintain your <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">motivation</span> when facing language and cultural differences or challenges on the job.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Think about your future career</p>

When considering working abroad, it is important to act with an eye on your <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">future career</span>, not just immediate employment. While overseas work can be a valuable experience, if you do not plan how to <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">leverage it for your next career step</span>, it may end up being only a temporary experience.

<br>

#### <div class="custom-title">How to find jobs abroad</div>

When looking for job opportunities abroad, the websites and tools you should use vary greatly depending on which country you want to work in and your current skills. The main <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">three</span> methods for searching for jobs overseas are as follows.
