Many international students supplement part of their living expenses through <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">part-time job</span>.

| Item                | Details                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Work Permit         | Must obtain a "`Permission to Engage in Activity Other Than That Permitted by the Status of Residence`" from the Immigration Bureau |
| Working Hours Limit | Up to `28 hours per week` (during long vacations: up to `8 hours per day`)                                                          |
