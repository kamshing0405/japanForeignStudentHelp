For international students to work part-time in Japan, there are <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">strict legal rules</span> that must be followed. Failure to understand these can lead to serious consequences, such as the denial of your visa renewal or even deportation.

#### <div class="custom-title">Obtaining "Permission" to Work</div>

A "Student" visa (Status of Residence: Student) is intended for studying, not for working. Before starting any part-time job, <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">you must verify your permission status</span> (Permission to Engage in Activity other than that Permitted).

| Work Permit   | Check the `back` of your Residence Card or your passport for a stamp/notation. If you don't have it, you must apply at the Immigration Bureau. |
| Studies First | If you `skip too many classes`, your visa renewal may be denied even if you have a work permit.                                                |

#### <div class="custom-title">The "28-Hour Wall" (Strict Limit)</div>

Japanese law places <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">strict limitations</span> on the number of hours an international student can work.

| 28 Hours/Week   | The total hours for all your part-time jobs combined `must not exceed 28 hours per week`.                                                |
| Multiple Jobs   | Even if you have `two or more jobs`, the grand total must still be within `28 hours`.                                                    |
| Violation Risks | Exceeding this by even `one minute` is a legal violation (overwork). It risks your future ability to find full-time employment in Japan. |
| Long Vacations  | Only during long vacations officially set by the school, you can work up to `8 hours a day (up to 40 hours a week)`.                     |

| SNS/Friends      | Getting a referral from a `senior` or `friend` is one of the most reliable and safe ways to find work.                                 |
