<h1 style="text-align: center;">Change of residence status</h1>

In Japan, hiring a foreign worker requires a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">work visa (residence status)</span>. Legally, the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">applicant themselves</span> must submit the application. However, the process is often complex, and it can be difficult for a foreign worker to complete it alone. Therefore, support from the hiring company is essential.

Also, since these procedures can <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">take time</span>, it is important to understand the overall process early.

In particular, for international students starting work in Japan, it is necessary to submit a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">application for change of residence status</span> at the Immigration Services Agency.

<br>

The status of residence to be changed will vary depending on the work duties at your new employer, but generally the following statuses of residence are applicable.

<span class="bg-blue-500 w-48 px-3 py-1 rounded-2xl text-4 text-sm text-white">It was consolidated as a result of the 2014 legal revision</span>

Commonly known as <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">技人国(Gijinkoku)</span>, this is the most frequently obtained residence status by international students working at Japanese companies.

It is required that there be a connection between <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">educational (or work) background and job responsibilities</span>, and its purpose is for foreign nationals to engage in work at Japanese companies or organizations that utilizes their specialized knowledge or skills.

The period of stay is <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">5 years, 3 years, 1 year, or 3 months</span>.

| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Technical     | Work that requires specialized knowledge and skills in `science` and `engineering` fields | System engineer, programmer, network engineer, mechanical/electrical design, architectural design, R&D, data analysis                      |
| Humanities    | Work that utilizes knowledge in `humanities` or `social sciences`                         | Sales, marketing, planning, accounting, finance, HR, legal affairs, consulting, finance-related tasks                                      |

<br>

However, being in one of the above job categories does not guarantee that a residence status will be granted.

The most important factor is whether the foreign worker’s past <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">educational and work background</span> has a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">sufficient connection</span> to the job they will be performing.

If these criteria are not met, the residence status application is likely to be <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">denied</span>.

- Nursing care, building cleaning
- Construction, industrial manufacturing
- Automobile maintenance, automobile transportation, railways, aviation, shipbuilding, and marine industries
- Accommodation

<br>

While the Technical/Humanities/International visa targets <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">white-collar</span> work that leverages university-level expertise, the Specified Skilled Worker visa places emphasis on <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">hands-on, on-site work</span> (including blue-collar tasks), which is a major difference.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Requirements for changing to "specific skilled worker"</p>

For international students changing to this visa, the relevance of their educational background is <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">not considered</span>. Instead, they must pass the following <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">two</span> exams.

1. `Skills Test`: An exam that measures specialized knowledge in the desired field (e.g., the Food Service Industry Skills Test).

2. `Japanese Language Test`: JLPT N4 or higher, or JFT-Basic A2 or higher.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Type 1 and Type 2</p>

The Specified Skilled Worker system is divided into <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">Type 1 and Type 2</span>. The Type 2 visa is granted to foreign nationals who possess advanced skills in a specific field.

In principle, it is positioned as the next-level qualification for those who have worked under a Type 1 visa.

<br>

Changing your status of residence (visa change) is an <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">important procedure</span> when your activities in Japan are going to change. Below are key points you should especially keep in mind when preparing your application.

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Application timing and schedule</p>

<div class="flex items-center text-center gap-2 h-6 mt-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-6 h-6 bg-[#00873c] text-white rounded-full text-sm font-bold shrink-0">1</span>
    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">In principle, the applicant must apply in person</p>
</div>

If the applicant does not submit the application themselves, a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">registered application agent</span> who has been notified to the local Immigration Bureau can carry out the application procedure on the applicant’s behalf.

    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-6 h-6 bg-[#00873c] text-white rounded-full text-sm font-bold shrink-0">2</span>
    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Pay attention to the period of stay</p>
</div>

It is <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">mandatory</span> to submit the application before your period of stay expires.

<div class="flex items-center text-center gap-2 h-6 mt-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-6 h-6 bg-[#00873c] text-white rounded-full text-sm font-bold shrink-0">3</span>
    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Submit your application well in advance</p>
</div>

Since it usually takes `1–3 months` to issue the Certificate of Eligibility, it is recommended to apply about 3 months before your planned arrival in Japan.

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Work content and documents</p>

<div class="flex items-center text-center gap-2 h-6 mt-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-6 h-6 bg-[#00873c] text-white rounded-full text-sm font-bold shrink-0">1</span>
    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Check your work content</p>
</div>

Always confirm that the work to be performed is within the `scope permitted by the foreign national’s residence status` (to avoid the risk of violating laws against promoting illegal employment).

<div class="flex items-center text-center gap-2 h-6 mt-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-6 h-6 bg-[#00873c] text-white rounded-full text-sm font-bold shrink-0">2</span>
    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Accuracy and consistency of documentation</p>
</div>

Since the required documents differ for each type of visa, check the `latest information` and ensure that everything is collected `accurately` and `completely`.

<div class="flex items-center text-center gap-2 h-6 mt-6">
    <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-6 h-6 bg-[#00873c] text-white rounded-full text-sm font-bold shrink-0">3</span>
    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Information Change</p>
</div>

If your address, workplace, marital status, or other details `change after applying`, you must promptly notify the immigration office, otherwise your approval may be `revoked`.
