<h1 style="text-align: center;">Overview of Job Hunting in Japan</h1>

Job hunting in Japan has a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">unique culture</span> compared to other countries, with systems that differ from those in your home country.

Many Japanese companies apply the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">same selection process</span> to international students as they do to Japanese applicants, which makes it quite challenging for students from abroad.

Therefore, it is <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">essential</span> to prepare thoroughly for your job search.

<span class="bg-blue-500 w-48 px-3 py-1 rounded-2xl text-4 text-sm text-white">Hire new graduates all at once after graduation</span>

Japan’s unique employment system is also known as <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">fixed-period recruitment</span>

Companies post job openings for graduating students in bulk by <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">academic year</span> and conduct recruitment activities targeting <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">currently enrolled students</span>

In Japan, many companies conduct new graduate recruitment according to a <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">similar schedule</span>

Generally, preparations start around <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">the summer of the third year</span> of university (or the first year of graduate school), and it is standard for job offers (informal or formal) to be given around <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">June of the fourth year</span> of university.

#### <div class="custom-title" id ='4月入社'>April Entry</div>

In Japan, many universities and vocational schools follow an academic year that starts in <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">April and ends in March</span>. Therefore, students who graduate in March typically begin their careers as working professionals all at once from <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">April 1</span>

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800 decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Characteristics of April Entry</p>

- Extensive new `employee training` (`many peers` joining at the same time)
- `Pre-assignment training` on business etiquette and basic skills
- `Seniority-based system `and `long-term employment`, focusing on a `development-oriented` recruitment approach
- Many hires are for `general positions` without a specific job assignment（<ruby>総合職<rp>(</rp><rt>そうごうしょく</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>）

<br>

#### <div class="custom-title" id ='4月入社'>October Entry</div>

This is the `Autumn Entry System`, conducted following the April intake

In recent years, more companies have introduced it as part of `year-round` recruitment or for hiring `global talent`

Known as “autumn recruitment for new graduates,” it targets students with `specific backgrounds`

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Characteristics of October Entr</p>

- `Fewer` peers joining at the same time (focus on `immediate contribution` and `specialized skills`)
- Many hires are for `specific job roles` (e.g., IT, engineering, language-related positions)
- `Shorter` training period, often centered on `on-the-job` training (OJT)
- Many positions are aimed at `international students` and graduates from `overseas universities`

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Potential-Based Recruitment</p>

- A recruitment method that emphasizes an applicant’s `future growth potential` and `latent abilities` (potential) rather than their current skills or experience.
- Many Japanese companies, especially traditional large corporations, operate under the assumption of `long-term` employment (`lifetime employment`).
  - Therefore, they focus more on whether an applicant can become a leader `10 or 20 years` from now, rather than what they can do immediately.
- Applicants are often evaluated based on the following qualities:
  - `Communication skills`, `initiative`, `willingness` to take on `challenges`, `teamwork`

<br>

### <div class="relative font-bold text-2xl pb-3 after:absolute after:left-0 after:bottom-0 after:w-full after:border-b-4 after:border-dotted after:border-blue-600">mid-career recruitment</div>

<span class="bg-blue-500 w-48 px-3 py-1 rounded-2xl text-4 text-sm text-white">Year-round recruitment, hiring as needed</span>

The hiring of individuals who already have <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">work experience</span> (i.e., professionals other than new graduates)

The hiring of individuals with <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">prior work experience</span> (i.e., those who are already professionals) rather than <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">new graduates</span>

The purpose is to quickly <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">secure talent</span> with the required skills and knowledge, in order to accelerate business operations and introduce expertise that the company does not currently have.

    <p class="text-[#00873c] font-bold text-lg pl-0.5">Individuals with no experience or from different industries</p>
</div>

<br>

<p class='text-dark-white font-bold underline decoration-red-800  decoration-4 underline-offset-8'>Recent Trends</p>

In recent years, Japan’s mid-career recruitment market has remained a seller’s market due to a serious <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">labor shortage</span>, intensifying competition among companies to secure talent. Specifically, in addition to the <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">growing demand for IT and specialized professionals driven by digital transformation (DX)</span>, there is an increasing trend of actively hiring <span class="font-bold bg-linear-to-t from-yellow-400/70 from-10% to-transparent to-50% dark:from-green-400/70">young professionals in their 20s and candidates with no prior experience</span>
